You stand on your doorstep, thinking how you miss that funny old chap... life feels strangely empty without his antics. But what's that? A tuft of white hair peeks over the horizon. You see a silhouetted figure begin to rotate, spinning faster and faster, before releasing something with the perfect form of an Olympic-level hammer throw. Time stands still as you fixate on the object sailing toward you. The arc it makes through the atmosphere is beautiful. Poetic. Like a rainbow. And then, it hits you. Literally, you get beaned in the head by a rather heavy bag. Good thing you were wearing your favorite 1951 standard-issue US Army Korean War helmet. WWII surplus, to get into the mood for watching a little MASH this morning. You pick the bag up, feeling that it's full of :-gp:, and look up to see the old man is gone once again. But you hear a cry from over the hill: \"I almost forgot, a little pocket money to stimulate the economyyyyyyyy!\" You open the bag and count the :-gp:. There are 85 of them.
