You stand on your doorstep, thinking how you miss that funny old chap... life feels strangely empty without his antics. But what's that? A tuft of white hair peeks over the horizon. You see a silhouetted figure begin to rotate, spinning faster and faster, before releasing something with the perfect form of an Olympic-level hammer throw. Time stands still as you fixate on the object sailing toward you. The arc it makes through the atmosphere is beautiful. Poetic. Like a rainbow. And then, it hits you. Literally, you get beaned in the head by a rather heavy bag. Good thing you were wearing your favorite 1951 standard-issue US Army Korean War helmet. WWII surplus, to get into the mood for watching a little MASH this morning. You pick the bag up, feeling that it's full of gp, and look up to see the old man is gone once again. But you hear a cry from over the hill: I almost forgot, a little pocket money to stimulate the economyyyyyyyy!",

Your mind still occasionally drifts to your eccentric friend, if you could even call him that. But mostly, at this point, you've moved on.\n\n...and then you hear him. Or rather, you hear a bagpipe. Accompanied by the unmistakable sound of a WWII surplus M4A3E8 Sherman tank trundling down the road. And there's only one person who would do a thing like that.\n\nYour suspicions are confirmed when you pull the curtain back and witness the amusing sight of the old man attempting to untangle his beard from the drone pipes without stopping either the music or the tank. He pulls up in front of your house, cuts the engine, stashes his bagpipe and hops out. You greet him at the door, and before you can say anything he shouts:\n\nYOU! You there! I've come to bring you something: this lovely {{replace}} Bread! I highly recommend you go to {{replace}} and run /use {{replace}}. You may be surprised and delighted by the rewards!!\n\nThis man has terrible breath. You open your mouth to respond, but he's already running back to his massive vehicle. The music starts back up and all you can do is watch him slowly advance to the next house down the road.\n\nActually, that's not all you can do. You could also go to {{replace}} right now and run /use {{replace}}.",
